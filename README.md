# Text to Speech using Hugging Face 🔊🤖

This is a **beginner-level Text-to-Speech (TTS) project** built while I am learning AI tools like
Hugging face AI and PyTorch.

The project converts text input into speech using pre-trained models.  
My main goal was to understand **how AI models are loaded, used, and tested**, not to build a perfect product.
